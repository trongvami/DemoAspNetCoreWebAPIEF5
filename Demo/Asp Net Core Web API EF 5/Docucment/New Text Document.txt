DI is a design pattern

Repository parttern
+ is an abstraction of data access layer. it hides the details of how exactly the data is saved or retrieved from the underlying data source.
+ the details of how the data is stored and retrieved is in the respective repository

benefits of repository pattern
+ the code is cleaner, and easier to reuse and maintain
+ enables us to create loosely coupled systems
+ in an unit testing project, it is easy to replace a real repository with a fake implementation for testing.

repository pattern interface
+ what operations are supported by the repository
+ the data required for each of the operations i.e the parameters that need to be passed to the method and the data the method returns
+ the implementation details are in the respective repository class that implements the repository interface.
